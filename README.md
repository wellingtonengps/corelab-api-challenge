## Corelab Challenge

Welcome to the **Corelab Challenge**! Here you'll show us how awesome you are at coding.
In order to do that, we've prepared two repositories which you will fork and program.

### The Challenge

You will create a web app which will consume an API to manage the CRUD of **vehicles**.

The frontend repository is this: https://github.com/corelabbr/corelab-web-challenge

If you feel more comfortable, you can pick another React framework and show us your skills.

The backend repository is this: https://github.com/corelabbr/corelab-api-challenge

If you feel more comfortable, you can pick another Node JS framework and show us your skills.

Try to show us all the skills you have, the more you do and care about the code, the more we get impressed. That's your **CHANCE**.
